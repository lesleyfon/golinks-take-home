## Instructions

    The requirements are purposely vague because we want to see how you can take a limited spec and create an application that is intuitive and user friendly. There is no right and wrong way to build this, as long as you can clearly communicate and justify your technical decisions and architecture. We’re looking to use any languages, frameworks, or libraries that you are comfortable with. Submission is due 1 week from receipt of the project. Please ZIP the project and either upload or email it to the recruiter. Any questions can be clarified with the recruiter.
